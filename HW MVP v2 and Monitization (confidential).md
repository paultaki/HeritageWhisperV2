# **Heritage Whisper Core Mission**

**We capture wisdom before it's gone. Every story becomes a lesson your family can replay forever.**

Every person has wisdom they don't know they carry. Our technology finds it, captures it in their voice, and makes it accessible in every family member's pocket forever. Not frozen in a book, but living and breathing \- growing richer with each story until it becomes their complete legacy.

## **Elevator Pitch**

HeritageWhisper captures wisdom, not just memories. Press record on your smartphone, tell a 2-minute story, and our AI asks one meaningful follow-up to extract the lesson learned. Every insight lives in the cloud \- accessible on every family member's phone, growing with each recording, never gathering dust on a shelf. It's a living legacy that updates until you can't anymore.

# **It's More Than Basic Memories**

The AI follow-up and lessons learned will be the big difference with my product. It's more than data/stories/memories. It creates an honoring legacy with personalized questions that come from YOUR stories, not generic prompts.

With thoughtful follow-ups and wisdom extraction, we carry the fullness of their life into the future. Something basic vanilla prompts can't do. Something a printed book can't update. Carefully crafted AI that learns from each story is the magic behind the curtain.

## **Competitive Wedge (Internal)**

Others collect essays for a book. HeritageWhisper captures wisdom for phones. Smartphone first. Personalized follow-ups. Living document that grows. Accessible everywhere, forever. Others create coffee table books. We create pocket legacies.
