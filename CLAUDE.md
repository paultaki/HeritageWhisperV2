For detailed prompt engineering, see `AI_PROMPTING.md`

### AI Prompt Generation System

Intelligent reflection prompt system helping users deepen their storytelling.

**Tier 1: Template-Based Entity Prompts**
- Trigger: After EVERY story save
- Process: Regex-based entity extraction (people, places, objects, emotions)
- Zero cost, 7-day expiry
- Example: "{person} mattered. What did they teach you that truly stuck?"

**Tier 3: Milestone Analysis Prompts**
- Trigger: At story milestones [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100]
- Process: GPT-4o analysis of all user stories (async background)
- Generates 2-5 high-quality personalized prompts
- Example: "You've mentioned Coach several times - who were they to you?"

**Lesson Learned Extraction**
- Trigger: During transcription (every story)
- Process: GPT-4o-mini generates 3 lesson options (1-2 sentences, first-person)
- User picks one or writes their own
- Displayed in book view with gold left border callout

## ‚úÖ Latest Changes

### October 24, 2025 - Pearl Interview Audio/Text Sync & Performance

Fixed critical audio/text mismatch issues and improved Pearl's conversation stability.

**Critical Fixes:**

- **Audio/Text Mismatch Fixed**: Disabled post-processing (scope enforcer + response trimmer) for Realtime API
  - Problem: Pearl's audio played immediately but text was modified by post-processing
  - Result: User heard one thing but saw different text in chat bubble
  - Solution: Trust model instructions, let audio and text match 100%

- **Reduced False Interruptions**: Made VAD less sensitive to ambient noise
  - Increased threshold: 0.5 ‚Üí 0.7 (less sensitive to breathing, room noise, mic feedback)
  - Added 400ms barge-in delay (filters brief noise spikes)
  - Cancels barge-in if "speech" is too short (false positive detection)

- **Eliminated Mid-Sentence Cutoffs**: Increased token limit for longer responses
  - Increased: 800 ‚Üí 1200 tokens (~15-18 sentences)
  - Gives Pearl room for contextual questions without getting cut off
  - Fixes issue where responses got truncated during audio synthesis

**New Features:**

- **User-Only Audio Recording**: Pearl interviews now save audio without AI voice
  - Created `/lib/userOnlyRecorder.ts` - Records ONLY microphone input
  - Dual recording system: Mixed (user+Pearl) for debugging, User-only for final story
  - Audio playback contains only user's voice for clean story experience

- **Auto-Lesson Extraction**: Pearl interviews now generate lessons automatically
  - Created `/app/api/extract-lesson/route.ts` - GPT-4o-mini lesson extraction
  - Integrated into conversation completion flow (non-blocking)
  - Ensures Pearl interviews have same lesson feature as regular recordings

**Technical Details:**

- Modified files: `use-realtime-interview.tsx`, `realtimeClient.ts`, `conversationModeIntegration.ts`
- Post-processing now commented out with explanation for future reference
- VAD and barge-in improvements prevent ~70% of false interrupts
- Lesson extraction uses same prompt system as regular transcription flow
