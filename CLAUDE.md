  - Photos were stored as blob URLs instead of actual files in Supabase
  - Implemented proper photo upload flow for edit mode
  - Added blob URL filtering in API endpoints
  - Photos now persist after hard browser refresh
  - Added filePath tracking separate from display URLs
- ✅ **API Improvements**:

  - POST `/api/stories`: Processes photos to extract file paths from signed URLs
  - POST `/api/stories/[id]/photos`: Returns both signed URL and filePath
  - Proper conversion between display URLs and storage paths

### Latest Improvements (10:45 AM - 2:00 PM PST)
- ✅ **Logo Updates**:
  - Updated to `HW_logo_mic_clean.png` across all pages

  - No blank pages ever appear
- ✅ **Text Area Expansion**: Widened text area to better utilize page space (padding reduced from 4rem to 2rem)
- ✅ **Edit Button Added**: Pencil icon on first page of each story for quick editing access

### Photo Persistence Fixes
- ✅ **Permanent Photo Storage**:
  - Fixed blob URLs being stored in database
  - Changed from temporary signed URLs to 1-week signed URLs
  - Photos now use storage paths, not URLs in database
  - Added proper photo upload flow for new stories
- ✅ **Upload Process Fixed**:
  - New stories upload photos to Supabase before saving
  - Existing photos properly retrieved with signed URLs
  - Blob URL filtering prevents invalid URLs from loading
- ✅ **API Improvements**:

  // In /app/api/stories/route.ts
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error creating signed URL for photo:', photoUrl, error);
    return null;  // Fixed: was returning photoUrl (the path)
  }
  return data?.signedUrl || null;  // Fixed: was returning photoUrl as fallback

- Edit existing stories (respecting ownership)
- Acts as joint account member
- Perfect for children/grandchildren adding their perspectives

### Sharing Flow

**Owner Creating a Share:**
1. Navigate to `/share` page
2. Enter recipient's email address
3. Choose permission level (View / Edit)
4. Optionally set expiration date
5. Click "Create Share Link"
6. Link automatically copied to clipboard
7. Share URL with recipient

**Recipient Accessing Shared Timeline:**
1. Click shared link: `/shared/[token]`
2. System verifies token and checks expiration
