## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Development Server
- **Port:** 3002 (3000 occupied)
- **Startup Time:** ~1 second
- **Hot Reload:** Instant with Fast Refresh
- **Page Compilation:** < 2 seconds

### Build Status
- **Development:** ✅ Working perfectly
- **Production Build:** ✅ Compiles successfully
- **TypeScript:** Minor linting warnings (non-breaking)
- **Bundle Size:** Optimized with code splitting

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Ready)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel

# Set all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
```

### Pre-deployment Status
- [x] All pages loading without errors
- [x] API endpoints functional
- [x] Authentication working
- [x] Database connected
- [x] Storage configured
- [x] Environment variables set
- [x] Mobile responsive
- [x] Production build successful

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Port 3002 instead of 3000** - Port 3000 is occupied by another process
2. **Multiple lockfiles warning** - Harmless, can be ignored or configured in next.config.js
3. **TypeScript warnings** - Non-breaking linting issues with `any` types
4. **Module not found** - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Clear cache and restart
rm -rf .next && npm run dev

# Install missing dependencies
npm install

# Production build test
npm run build

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

- ✅ **Successfully migrated from Neon to Supabase database**:
  - Switched from external Neon database to Supabase's built-in PostgreSQL
  - Updated DATABASE_URL to use paultaki project's database
  - Resolved "Tenant or user not found" errors
- ✅ **Fixed authentication and storage integration**:
  - Using paultaki Supabase project for auth, database, and storage
  - Single unified backend instead of mixed services
  - heritage-whisper-files bucket working for audio and photos
- ✅ **Adapted to existing Supabase schema**:
  - Modified API routes to work with existing table structure
  - Stories table uses `transcript` instead of `transcription`
  - Metadata stored in JSONB column for flexibility
  - Fixed duration_seconds constraint (must be 1-120)
- ✅ **Stories now saving successfully**:

- ⚠️ **Known issue - Photos not uploading**:
  - Photos are blob URLs that need upload before save
  - Created /api/upload/photo endpoint
  - Frontend needs update to upload photos before story save

## 📝 Recent Updates (January 3, 2025)

### Complete Photo Persistence Fix (4:35 PM PST)
- ✅ **Fixed Critical Photo Storage Issue**:
  - Photos were stored as blob URLs instead of actual files in Supabase
  - Implemented proper photo upload flow for edit mode
  - Added blob URL filtering in API endpoints
  - Photos now persist after hard browser refresh
  - Added filePath tracking separate from display URLs
- ✅ **API Improvements**:
  - PUT `/api/stories/[id]`: Filters blob URLs and uploads pending photos
  - POST `/api/stories`: Processes photos to extract file paths from signed URLs
  - POST `/api/stories/[id]/photos`: Returns both signed URL and filePath
  - Proper conversion between display URLs and storage paths

### Latest Improvements (10:45 AM - 2:00 PM PST)
- ✅ **Logo Updates**:
  - Updated to `HW_logo_mic_clean.png` across all pages
  - Consistent branding in navigation and authentication pages
- ✅ **Edit Button Navigation Fix**:
  - Edit button in book view now navigates to book-style review page
  - Maintains visual consistency when editing from book view
- ✅ **Audio Recording Controls**:
  - Added audio player to review pages for playback
  - "Remove Audio" button to delete recordings
  - "Re-record" button for new recordings
  - Duration display in MM:SS format
- ✅ **Photo Loading Fix**:
  - Switched to signed URLs with 1-week expiry for reliable photo access
  - Added error handling with public URL fallback
  - Async photo URL generation for proper API handling

### Book View Enhancements
- ✅ **True Book Pagination Implemented**:
  - Stories flow naturally across pages like a real book
  - Text splits at sentence boundaries for clean reading
  - Visual balance algorithm ensures even page spreads
  - Decade markers always start on left pages
  - No blank pages ever appear
- ✅ **Text Area Expansion**: Widened text area to better utilize page space (padding reduced from 4rem to 2rem)
- ✅ **Edit Button Added**: Pencil icon on first page of each story for quick editing access

### Photo Persistence Fixes
- ✅ **Permanent Photo Storage**:
  - Fixed blob URLs being stored in database
  - Changed from temporary signed URLs to 1-week signed URLs
  - Photos now use storage paths, not URLs in database
  - Added proper photo upload flow for new stories
- ✅ **Upload Process Fixed**:
  - New stories upload photos to Supabase before saving
  - Existing photos properly retrieved with signed URLs
  - Blob URL filtering prevents invalid URLs from loading
- ✅ **API Improvements**:
  - `/api/stories/[id]/photos/route.ts`: Stores file paths instead of signed URLs
  - `/api/stories/route.ts`: Returns signed URLs with 1-week expiry
  - `/api/objects/upload/route.ts`: Properly generates upload URLs

### Photo Storage Architecture
- **Storage Path vs Display URL**: Photos are stored in database with file paths (e.g., `userId/storyId/filename.jpg`)
- **Signed URLs**: Generated on-the-fly when fetching stories (1-week expiry for reliability)
- **Upload Flow**:
  1. Client uploads to signed upload URL
  2. File stored in Supabase Storage
  3. Path saved to database
  4. Signed URL returned for immediate display
- **Edit Mode**: Photos upload immediately when selected, blob URLs are filtered out on save

- ✅ **Code Change**:
  ```typescript
  // In /app/api/stories/route.ts
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error creating signed URL for photo:', photoUrl, error);
    return null;  // Fixed: was returning photoUrl (the path)
  }
  return data?.signedUrl || null;  // Fixed: was returning photoUrl as fallback
  ```
