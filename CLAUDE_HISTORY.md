- **Database Schema**: `users` and `user_agreements` tables with audit trail
- **API Endpoints**: Accept, status, and registration integration
- **Frontend Components**: AgreementGuard, AgreementModal, status hook
- **Resend Email Integration**: Verification and welcome emails

### October 5, 2025 - Critical Fixes

- **Login to Register Navigation**: Fixed inline form toggle, now properly navigates to `/auth/register`
- **Audio Upload MIME Types**: Updated Supabase bucket to allow all audio formats (was only allowing webm/ogg)
- **Timeline Decade Sorting**: Birth year section now correctly appears before same-decade stories
- **Legal Documents Update**: Removed wisdom clips and character traits references from Terms & Privacy pages
- **RLS Security**: Enabled RLS on `recording_sessions` and `usage_tracking` tables
- **RLS Performance**: Optimized all policies to use `(SELECT auth.uid())` pattern instead of `auth.uid()`
- **Function Security**: Fixed `increment_view_count` search path with `SET search_path = public, pg_temp`
- **Email Confirmation Flow**: Fixed redirect to go directly to `/timeline` after email verification
- **Duplicate Agreement Modal**: Fixed by using service role key in registration to properly set agreement versions
- **Resend SMTP**: Configured email sending via custom domain (no-reply@updates.heritagewhisper.com)

### October 8, 2025 - Book View & UI Enhancements

#### Book View Premium Layout (Tagged: `book-view-premium-v1`)

- **Intelligent Viewport Switching**: Automatic spread ‚Üî single-page mode based on available width and minimum font size (18px body text)
- **Fixed Header/Footer Alignment**: Corrected desktop nav width calculations (80px ‚Üí 112px)
  - `.book-header` now properly aligns with left sidebar (w-28 = 112px)
  - `.book-container` centering calculation updated to account for correct sidebar width
  - Removed 48px gap between header and sidebar
  - Fixed ~38px overlap of container with sidebar
- **Premium Single-Page Mode**: Spine hint with proper depth, centered content with explicit width
- **Navigation Arrows**: Fixed z-index (45) and mobile visibility, positioned at 120px on desktop (past 80px sidebar)
- **Export PDF Button**: Added 60px right margin to avoid hamburger menu overlap
- **Class-Based Styling**: Switched from media queries to `.spread-mode` and `.single-mode` classes for better control
- **Mobile Optimization**: Maximized content width with slim brown border, proper touch targets (64px)
- **Removed Decade Navigation**: Simplified book view by removing decade nav pills
- All changes are screen-only (no print/PDF export modifications)

#### PDF Export Margins

- **Fixed Centering Issue**: Content no longer stuck to top-left corner or bleeding onto extra pages
  - Created `/app/book/print/layout.tsx` to bypass root layout wrapper
  - Added CSS overrides to reset parent div padding
  - Used `.book-spread` with `padding: 0.25in` and `box-sizing: border-box` (keeps total height at exactly 8.5in)
  - Set `.spread-content` to `width: 100%; height: 100%` to fill the padded area
  - Result: Equal 0.25in margins on all sides without overflow

#### Blank Pages on Initial Book Load

- **Problem**: BookView showed blank pages on first visit, required refresh to display content
- **Root Causes**:
  - Font loading blocked pagination (waiting for `document.fonts.ready`)
  - Pagination waited for `fontsReady` state before calculating
  - If fonts failed to load, pagination never occurred
- **Solution**: Optimistic rendering
  - Added font preloading in `/app/layout.tsx` (Playfair Display, Crimson Text)
  - Modified pagination to run immediately with fallback metrics
  - Font wait happens in parallel, triggers re-pagination when fonts load
  - Result: Instant page display with automatic refinement when fonts ready
- Location: `/app/book/page.tsx:430-462`, `/app/layout.tsx:25-36`

#### Audio Progress Bar Gradient (Mobile)

- **Problem**: Gradient fill not visible below 900px width (appeared as gray bar)
- **Debug Process**: Added console logging revealed element was 16px√ó16px instead of stretching
- **Root Cause**: CSS class `.audio-fill` inherited default 16px font-size, making element fixed size
- **Solution**: Removed `className="audio-fill"` entirely, used pure inline styles with `fontSize: "0"`
- Location: `/app/book/page.tsx:355-375`

#### Mobile Audio Player Height

- **Reduced Vertical Space**: Made ~20-25% shorter on mobile
  - Button sizes: 40px ‚Üí 36px (desktop), 44px ‚Üí 40px (mobile)
  - Icon sizes: 16px ‚Üí 14px (mobile)
  - Reduced margins and padding throughout
- Location: `/app/book/page.tsx:330-340`

## üêõ Historical Issues & Solutions

### Audio Upload Issues (October 5, 2025)

**Multiple Attempts:**

1. ‚ùå Tried removing explicit contentType ‚Üí Defaulted to text/plain
2. ‚ùå Tried setting contentType to `audio/mpeg` ‚Üí Rejected as unsupported
3. ‚ùå Tried wrapping File in new File() ‚Üí Converted to string
4. ‚ùå Tried direct Blob upload ‚Üí Still MIME type issues
5. ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSE**: Supabase bucket `allowed_mime_types` only had webm/ogg

**Final Solution:**

```sql
UPDATE storage.buckets
SET allowed_mime_types = ARRAY[
  'audio/webm', 'audio/ogg', 'audio/mpeg', 'audio/mp3',
  'audio/wav', 'audio/wave', 'audio/mp4', 'audio/m4a',
  'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'
]
WHERE name = 'heritage-whisper-files';
```

**Key Learning:** When Supabase says "mime type X is not supported", check the bucket configuration first, not the code.

### Timeline Sorting (Recurring Issue)

**Problem:** Stories from same decade as birth year appearing before birth year section

**Iterations:**

1. October 4, 2025: Fixed by using earliest story year for decade sorting
2. October 5, 2025: Re-fixed after issue recurred - now detects birth decade and uses earliest story year only for that decade

**Solution Location:** `/app/timeline/page.tsx:1194-1199`

### Photo Upload Issues (January 3, 2025)

**Problem:** Photos stored as blob URLs instead of Supabase paths

**Solution:**

- Store file paths in database (not URLs)
- Generate signed URLs with 1-week expiry on-demand
- Blob URL filtering in API endpoints
- Proper upload flow for both new and edited stories

### Authentication Race Conditions

**Problem:** 401 errors when timeline/book view loaded immediately after login

**Solution:**

- Session retry logic (5x 100ms delays)
- Query invalidation after login
- Check for both `user` AND `session` before fetching data

### Email Confirmation & Agreement Modal (October 5, 2025)

**Problem:** After email confirmation, users saw duplicate agreement modal even though they accepted at signup

**Root Causes:**

1. Email confirmation redirected to homepage instead of `/auth/callback`
2. `/auth/callback` had conditional logic checking birth year
3. Registration used anon key instead of service role key
4. RLS policies blocked setting `latest_terms_version`/`latest_privacy_version` columns
5. Agreement status check didn't properly query `user_agreements` table

**Solutions:**

1. Updated Supabase redirect URLs to include `https://dev.heritagewhisper.com/auth/callback`
2. Changed `/auth/callback` to always redirect to `/timeline` (birth year already collected at signup)
3. Changed registration to use service role key: `createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceKey)`
4. Fixed `/api/agreements/status` fallback to check both terms AND privacy in `user_agreements` table
5. Updated agreement status query to properly detect both agreement types

**Key Files Modified:**

- `/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Service role key
- `/app/auth/callback/page.tsx` - Direct timeline redirect
- `/app/api/agreements/status/route.ts` - Improved fallback logic

2. **File/Blob objects lose MIME type** when wrapped with `new File([blob])`
3. **Timeline sorting requires special handling** for birth year vs decades
4. **Session race conditions** need retry logic after login
5. **Signed URLs with expiry** better than storing URLs in database
6. **Mobile text justification** causes huge gaps, use left-align
7. **Z-index stacking** requires careful planning for overlapping elements

### October 8, 2025 - PDF Export Feature

**PDF Export Implementation:**

- Export button with dropdown menu in book view header
- Two export formats:
  - **2-up (Home Print)**: Two 5.5√ó8.5" pages side-by-side on 11√ó8.5" landscape
  - **Trim (POD)**: Individual 5.5√ó8.5" pages for professional printing
- Server-side PDF generation using Puppeteer + @sparticuz/chromium
- Print-specific pages at `/book/print/2up` and `/book/print/trim`
- API routes: `/api/export/2up`, `/api/export/trim`, `/api/book-data`
- Uses service role key to bypass auth for print pages
- Created `/app/book/print/layout.tsx` to bypass root layout wrapper

**PDF Export Margin Fix (October 8, 2025):**

- Issue: Content stuck to top-left corner and bleeding onto extra pages
- Root cause: Root layout adding `md:pl-20 pb-20 md:pb-0` padding to all pages
- Solution:
  - Created minimal print layout to bypass wrapper padding
  - Added CSS overrides: `body > * { padding: 0 !important }`
  - Used `.book-spread` with `padding: 0.25in` and `box-sizing: border-box`
  - Set `.spread-content` to `width: 100%; height: 100%` to fill padded area
  - Result: Equal 0.25in margins on all sides without overflow

### October 2025 - Project Cleanup

## Recent Updates Archive (2025)

### January 23, 2025 - Single Story Sharing Removed

Removed all single story sharing functionality while preserving family sharing features.

**What Was Removed:**
- Share button from HamburgerMenu
- Share button from LeftSidebar navigation
- Share button from MemoryOverlay (story detail view)
- `/app/share` page and route
- `/app/api/share` API endpoints
- `Share2` icon imports from Timeline components

**What Was Kept:**
- Family sharing functionality (`/app/api/shared/*` endpoints)
- Family member invites and permissions
- Family timeline and book views
- All `/app/family/*` routes

**Reason:** Single story sharing was not being used and added unnecessary complexity. Family sharing provides the collaborative features needed for families to share entire collections.

### January 22, 2025 - Family Sharing V3 Critical Bug Fixes

Fixed three critical bugs preventing account switching from working properly:

**1. Database Field Name Mismatch (Primary Bug)**
- **Problem**: Account switcher showed family members but clicking them didn't switch accounts
- **Root Cause**: PostgreSQL returns snake_case field names but frontend expects camelCase
- **Fix**: Added field mapping layer in `/api/accounts/available` endpoint

**2. React Key Warning on Fragment**
- **Problem**: Console warning about missing key prop
- **Fix**: Changed to named Fragment with key

**3. Server Build Cache Corruption**
- **Problem**: Multiple dev server instances running simultaneously
- **Fix**: Killed processes, cleared `.next` cache, restarted cleanly

### January 22, 2025 - Prompts Library Header Layout Fixes

**Problems:**
1. Header was constrained by sidebar flex container
2. Header too tall on desktop (excessive padding)
3. AccountSwitcher positioning inconsistent

**Fixes:**
- Restructured page layout with header outside flex container
- Reduced padding: `py-4 md:py-6` ‚Üí `py-3 md:py-3`
- Reduced title size: `text-4xl` ‚Üí `text-2xl` on desktop
- Matches Timeline header height (55px)

### January 21, 2025 - Critical Security Fix - Row Level Security

Fixed critical RLS vulnerabilities flagged by Supabase security linter on 4 tables.

**Problem:**
- RLS disabled on: `users`, `recording_sessions`, `stories`, `usage_tracking`
- Tables exposed to potential unauthorized access

**Solution:**
- Created migration `/migrations/0011_fix_missing_rls.sql`
- Implements defensive checks (only enables if disabled)
- Creates comprehensive policies for each table

### October 21, 2025 - Pearl Scope Enforcement

Implemented comprehensive scope enforcement for Pearl (OpenAI Realtime API guided interviews) to prevent off-topic responses.

**Solution: Defense in Depth**
1. Updated system instructions with hard refusal templates
2. Server-side scope enforcer (`/lib/scopeEnforcer.ts`) with regex detection
3. Response token limit (150 tokens max)
4. Integration in response pipeline

**Expected Impact:**
- 95%+ reduction in off-topic responses
- Consistent refusal patterns
- Automatic redirection back to story capture

### October 21, 2025 - Interview Chat V1 Improvements

**Reverted to Traditional Whisper Transcription:**
- Disabled Realtime API for V1 via `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_REALTIME=false`
- Uses traditional MediaRecorder + AssemblyAI batch transcription
- Faster, simpler, cheaper flow

**Fixed Audio Chunking Bug:**
- Problem: Second audio response failed with "Invalid file format" 400 error
- Root Cause: Code was slicing WebM blobs into chunks, creating invalid audio files
- Fix: Send complete audio blob to transcription API instead of sliced chunks

**Added Session Timer & Auto-Complete:**
- 30-minute hard limit with auto-complete
- 25-minute warning badge
- Final minute countdown with red pulsing animation

### October 20, 2025 - Conversation Mode & Quick Story Wizard Integration

Fixed critical bugs preventing new recording flows from saving stories.

**1. NavCache Data Race Condition:**
- Problem: Wizard mode showed "No data found in NavCache" error
- Fix: Added `!isWizardMode` condition to skip regular NavCache consumption

**2. Authentication Headers Missing:**
- Problem: API requests returned 401 Unauthorized errors
- Fix: Added session token to all upload and save endpoints

**3. API Field Name Mismatch:**
- Problem: Story creation returned 400 validation error
- Fix: Changed `transcript` to `transcription` to match API schema

### October 20, 2025 - PDFShift Migration
