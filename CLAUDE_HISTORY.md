- **Sharing System**: Permission-based sharing (view/edit) - 80% complete

### January 4, 2025 - Mobile UX Optimization
- **Book View Mobile**: Fixed navigation footer z-index, photo carousel redesign
- **Timeline Spacing**: Optimized left margin for wider cards on mobile
- **Audio Upload Formats**: Added support for MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A
- **Text Justification**: Fixed huge gaps on mobile by changing to left-align
- **Mobile Header**: Better spacing and tap targets (44x44px minimum)

### October 4, 2025 - Legal Compliance

### October 5, 2025 - Critical Fixes
- **Login to Register Navigation**: Fixed inline form toggle, now properly navigates to `/auth/register`

## üêõ Historical Issues & Solutions

### Audio Upload Issues (October 5, 2025)

**Multiple Attempts:**
1. ‚ùå Tried removing explicit contentType ‚Üí Defaulted to text/plain
2. ‚ùå Tried setting contentType to `audio/mpeg` ‚Üí Rejected as unsupported
3. ‚ùå Tried wrapping File in new File() ‚Üí Converted to string
4. ‚ùå Tried direct Blob upload ‚Üí Still MIME type issues
5. ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSE**: Supabase bucket `allowed_mime_types` only had webm/ogg

**Final Solution:**
```sql
UPDATE storage.buckets
SET allowed_mime_types = ARRAY[
  'audio/webm', 'audio/ogg', 'audio/mpeg', 'audio/mp3',
  'audio/wav', 'audio/wave', 'audio/mp4', 'audio/m4a',
  'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'
]
WHERE name = 'heritage-whisper-files';
```

**Key Learning:** When Supabase says "mime type X is not supported", check the bucket configuration first, not the code.

### Timeline Sorting (Recurring Issue)

**Problem:** Stories from same decade as birth year appearing before birth year section

**Iterations:**
1. October 4, 2025: Fixed by using earliest story year for decade sorting
2. October 5, 2025: Re-fixed after issue recurred - now detects birth decade and uses earliest story year only for that decade

**Solution Location:** `/app/timeline/page.tsx:1194-1199`

### Photo Upload Issues (January 3, 2025)

**Problem:** Photos stored as blob URLs instead of Supabase paths

**Solution:**
- Store file paths in database (not URLs)
- Generate signed URLs with 1-week expiry on-demand
- Blob URL filtering in API endpoints
- Proper upload flow for both new and edited stories

### Authentication Race Conditions

**Problem:** 401 errors when timeline/book view loaded immediately after login

**Solution:**
- Session retry logic (5x 100ms delays)
- Query invalidation after login
- Check for both `user` AND `session` before fetching data

## üîß Database Schema Changes

### October 4, 2025 - Legal Compliance
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  birth_year INTEGER,
  latest_terms_version TEXT,
  latest_privacy_version TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE public.user_agreements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  agreement_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  version TEXT NOT NULL,
  accepted_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  ip_address TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  method TEXT
);
```

### January 3, 2025 - Sharing System
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.shared_access (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  owner_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  shared_with_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  shared_with_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  permission_level TEXT DEFAULT 'view',
  share_token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  last_accessed_at TIMESTAMPTZ

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Always check bucket configuration first** when Supabase rejects MIME types
2. **File/Blob objects lose MIME type** when wrapped with `new File([blob])`
3. **Timeline sorting requires special handling** for birth year vs decades
4. **Session race conditions** need retry logic after login
5. **Signed URLs with expiry** better than storing URLs in database
6. **Mobile text justification** causes huge gaps, use left-align
7. **Z-index stacking** requires careful planning for overlapping elements
