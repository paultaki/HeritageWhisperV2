# HeritageWhisperV2 - Test Deployment Status

## 🚀 Current Deployment Status
**Last Updated:** December 19, 2024
**Deployment URL:** https://www.joblessbyai.com
**GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/paultaki/HeritageWhisperV2
**Vercel Project:** Connected and auto-deploying from main branch

## 🔴 PENDING ACTION REQUIRED
**IMPORTANT:** There is a pending commit that needs to be pushed to GitHub:
```bash
cd /Users/paul/Documents/DevProjects/HeritageWhisperV2
git push origin main
```

This commit contains a critical fix for the login functionality. Without it, users cannot sign in.

## 📝 What We've Done

### 1. Created Separate Test Deployment
- ✅ Created new GitHub repository: HeritageWhisperV2
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel at joblessbyai.com
- ✅ Completely separate from production HeritageWhisper.com site

### 2. Fixed Build & Deployment Issues
- ✅ Removed environment variable references from vercel.json
- ✅ Fixed SSR compatibility issues (window checks, Suspense boundaries)
- ✅ Removed bcrypt v6.0.0 (incompatible with Vercel)
- ✅ Created missing forgot-password page

### 3. Configured Supabase (Separate Project)
- ✅ Created new Supabase project for testing
- ✅ Added all environment variables to Vercel:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.joblessbyai.com

### 4. Fixed Authentication Issue
- ✅ Simplified login to use Supabase Auth only
- ✅ Removed PostgreSQL database dependency
- ⚠️ **Commit created but NOT pushed to GitHub yet**

## 🔧 Current Architecture

### Simplified Auth Flow (Temporary for Testing)
The app now uses a simplified authentication flow:
1. **Supabase Auth Only** - No separate PostgreSQL database required
2. User data stored in Supabase Auth metadata
3. Login/Register functionality working
4. Story storage features will need database configuration later

### Original Architecture (For Reference)
The full app uses:
- Supabase Auth for authentication
- PostgreSQL database (via Drizzle ORM) for user data and stories
- Supabase Storage for audio/photos

## 📋 Environment Variables (All Set in Vercel)

```env
# Supabase Configuration (New test project)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-test-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-test-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-test-service-key

# Site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.joblessbyai.com

# Other required variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret

# Database (NOT configured yet - using Supabase Auth only)
DATABASE_URL=not-configured-yet
```

## 🚦 What's Working

### After You Push the Pending Commit:
- ✅ Homepage loads
- ✅ Login page accessible
- ✅ Registration will work
- ✅ Login will work
- ✅ User sessions maintained
- ✅ Forgot password flow

### What Won't Work Yet:
- ❌ Story creation/storage (needs database)
- ❌ Timeline view (needs database)
- ❌ Profile updates (needs database)

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate (Do This Now):
1. **Push the pending commit to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/paul/Documents/DevProjects/HeritageWhisperV2
   git push origin main
   ```
   - You'll need GitHub credentials or Personal Access Token
   - If 2FA is enabled, use a Personal Access Token as password

2. **Wait for Vercel to redeploy** (automatic, takes ~1-2 minutes)

3. **Test login at joblessbyai.com**

### Future (After Basic Auth Works):
1. **Option A: Use Supabase's PostgreSQL**
   - Get database connection string from Supabase project
   - Add as DATABASE_URL in Vercel
   - Run database migrations

2. **Option B: Keep simplified auth**
   - Modify other endpoints to work without database
   - Good for basic testing only

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If login still doesn't work after pushing:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure Supabase project is active

### Common Issues:
- **401 errors on /api/auth/me** - Normal, checking if user logged in
- **401 on /api/auth/login** - Fixed by pending commit
- **GitHub push fails** - Need to set up authentication/PAT
