ORIGINAL STORY:
${story}

STORY METADATA:
${title ? `Title: ${title}` : ''}
${year ? `Year: ${year}` : ''}
Current word count: ${currentWordCount} words

YOUR TASK:
Rewrite this memory to be more compelling, captivating, and vivid while:

1. **Preserve the facts**: Do NOT invent new facts, people, or events that weren't in the original. Stay true to what happened.
2. **Match the tone**: Understand if this is humorous, serious, reflective, sad, angry, nostalgic, etc. Write in the SAME emotional tone.
3. **Match their voice**: Write as if the author is telling it. Keep their personality and style.
4. **Bring it to life**: Add sensory details, emotional depth, and visual imagery that COULD have been there based on the context.
5. **Fill in gaps naturally**: If something is implied but not explicit, you may describe it (e.g., "the summer heat" if it's July, "the smell of pine" if in a forest).
6. **Target length**: Aim for ${targetWords} words (Â±20). This will fit nicely in a ${targetWords === 220 ? '2' : '3'}-page spread in the printed book.
7. **Use short paragraphs**: Break the story into 3-5 short, punchy paragraphs. Each paragraph should be 2-4 sentences max.
8. **Conversational**: Write like someone telling a story over coffee, not a formal essay.

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Don't add new characters that weren't mentioned
- Don't invent dialogue unless implied
- Don't change the core event or outcome
- Don't make it flowery or overly poetic
- Don't add a moral or lesson (that's handled separately)

Return ONLY the enhanced story text, nothing else. No preamble, no explanation.`;
