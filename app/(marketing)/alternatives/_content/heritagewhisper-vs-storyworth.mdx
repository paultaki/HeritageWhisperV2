StoryWorth has been the go-to for family story preservation for years. HeritageWhisper offers a different approach. Here's an honest comparison to help you decide which is right for your family.

## The Core Difference

**StoryWorth** sends weekly questions via email. Your loved one types their answers. After a year, everything compiles into a printed book.

**HeritageWhisper** lets your loved one record their stories by voice. AI transcribes the audio. Family members can listen to recordings and read transcripts anytime.

This fundamental difference—typing vs. talking—shapes everything else.

| **Prompts** | Guided, adaptive | Weekly email questions |
| **Family Access** | Instant sharing | After book completion |

| **Free Tier** | Yes | No |
| **Starting Price** | Free | $99/year |

## Voice vs. Text: Why It Matters

### Why Voice Recording (HeritageWhisper)

**For the storyteller:**
- Talking is natural—most people speak 5x faster than they type
- No struggling with keyboards, especially for seniors with arthritis
- Stories flow more naturally in conversation
- Captures tone, emotion, laughter, and pauses

**For the family:**
- Hearing Grandma's voice is different from reading her words
- Audio recordings become more precious over time
- Can listen while driving, cooking, or doing other activities
- Voice has emotional impact text can't replicate

### Why Text (StoryWorth)

**For the storyteller:**
- Time to think and edit responses
- Private writing environment
- Can work on answers gradually over days
- Some people express themselves better in writing

**For the family:**
- Easy to read and search
- Professional printed book at the end
- Simple to share excerpts

## Who Each Platform Serves Best

### HeritageWhisper is better for:

- **Seniors who don't like typing** — Voice recording removes the keyboard barrier
- **Families who want to preserve the voice** — Audio is irreplaceable
- **People with great stories but limited patience** — Talking is faster
- **Those with vision or motor challenges** — Large buttons, simple interface
- **Families wanting immediate access** — Share recordings instantly

### StoryWorth is better for:

- **Parents who enjoy writing** — Some people genuinely prefer it
- **Those who want a guaranteed physical book** — It's included in the price
- **Gift-givers wanting a complete package** — Clear one-year timeline
- **People who need time to compose thoughts** — Writing allows editing

## Pricing Breakdown

### HeritageWhisper

- **Free tier**: Limited recordings, core features
- **Premium**: $79/year - Unlimited recordings, full family sharing, priority AI

### StoryWorth

- **Single price**: $99/year - Includes printed book at end
- **Additional books**: Extra cost

**The math**: HeritageWhisper is $20/year cheaper. If you print a book through a service like Blurb, total cost is similar. The difference is whether you value voice recordings or prefer the guaranteed book.

## Feature Deep Dive

### Prompts & Questions

**HeritageWhisper** uses AI-powered prompts that adapt based on previous stories. The system learns what topics resonate and suggests related questions.

**StoryWorth** sends pre-written questions weekly via email. You can skip or customize questions. The format is consistent and predictable.

### Family Sharing

**HeritageWhisper** lets family members listen to recordings and read transcripts immediately. Multiple family members can have accounts and follow along as stories are recorded.

**StoryWorth** keeps stories private until the book is complete. Family access happens when you gift or share the finished book.

### The Book

**HeritageWhisper** exports to PDF, which you can print through any service or keep digital. You control the format and timing.

**StoryWorth** produces a professionally designed hardcover book after one year. The design is handled for you.

### Audio Preservation

**HeritageWhisper** keeps original voice recordings forever. Your grandchildren can hear their great-grandmother's actual voice.

**StoryWorth** is text-only. No audio component.

## Real Talk: Limitations

### HeritageWhisper Limitations

- No guaranteed physical book (you handle printing)
- Requires active recording (not passive email)
- AI transcription isn't perfect (we fix most errors, but some slip through)
- Newer platform, smaller community

### StoryWorth Limitations

- No voice/audio preservation
- Typing-only excludes many seniors
- Year-long commitment before book
- Can't easily share stories before completion
- No free tier to try

## Questions to Ask Your Family

Before choosing, consider:

1. **Does your loved one prefer talking or typing?** This is the biggest factor.

2. **How important is preserving their actual voice?** If it matters, HeritageWhisper is the only option.

3. **Do you want immediate access to stories?** HeritageWhisper shares instantly; StoryWorth waits for the book.

4. **Is a physical book the main goal?** StoryWorth guarantees one; HeritageWhisper requires you to arrange printing.

5. **What's your budget?** HeritageWhisper has a free tier; StoryWorth is $99 minimum.

## Our Honest Take

We built HeritageWhisper because we watched family members struggle with typing-based platforms. Grandpa had incredible stories but gave up after two emails because typing was painful.

StoryWorth works beautifully for people who enjoy writing. If your parent already sends long emails full of stories, StoryWorth might be perfect.

But if you've ever thought "I wish I could just record them talking," HeritageWhisper is what you're looking for.

## Try Before You Decide

HeritageWhisper has a free tier—you can record stories and see how it works before paying anything.

StoryWorth doesn't offer a free trial, but their refund policy is reasonable if you decide it's not right.
