When a loved one's health is declining, every conversation becomes precious. This guide helps you capture the most important stories when time is limited.

## Prioritize What Matters Most

With limited time, you can't capture everything. Focus on these essential areas:

### Identity Stories
- "Tell me about where our family comes from."
- "What's the proudest moment of your life?"
- "What do you want people to remember about you?"

### Relationship Stories
- "How did you and [spouse] meet?"
- "What's your favorite memory of [their children]?"
- "Tell me about your best friend."

### Wisdom Stories
- "What's the most important thing you've learned?"
- "What advice would you give your grandchildren?"
- "What values matter most to you?"

### Untold Stories
- "Is there anything you've never told anyone?"
- "What story from your life would make a great movie?"
- "What do you wish you'd done differently?"

## Make Every Session Count

### Keep Sessions Short
Fifteen to twenty minutes is often ideal when someone is unwell. Multiple short conversations beat one exhausting session.

### Choose the Right Time
- After rest, not before
- When pain medication is working but they're still alert
- Not right after meals
- When they seem emotionally ready

### Minimize Distractions
- Silence phones
- Close doors
- Turn off TVs
- Ask healthcare workers for uninterrupted time

### Have Questions Ready
Don't waste precious energy deciding what to ask. Come prepared with a short list of priority questions.

## Technical Simplicity

Now is not the time for complicated setups.

**Use your smartphone.** The voice recorder app that comes with every phone is sufficient. Quality matters less than capturing the story at all.

**Test briefly first.** Do a five-second test and play it back. Can you hear clearly? Good—move on.

**Record more than you think.** Start recording before you think the conversation begins. Stories emerge unexpectedly.

**Back up immediately.** Text or email recordings to yourself before leaving. Technology fails at the worst times.

## When Words Are Difficult

As health declines, verbal communication may become challenging.

### Yes/No Questions
When long answers are too tiring, use yes/no questions:
- "Was your childhood happy?"
- "Did you love your job?"
- "Are you proud of how you raised your children?"

### Photo Prompts
Looking at photographs often unlocks memories more easily than open questions:
- "Who is this person?"
- "Where was this taken?"
- "What do you remember about this day?"

### Written Notes
If speaking is difficult, they might still be able to write or type short responses.

### Just Be Present
Sometimes the most precious recording is simply their voice—laughing, humming, saying "I love you." These recordings matter too.

## What to Say When It's Hard

### Starting the Conversation
"I want to make sure your stories live on. Would you share some memories with me?"

### When They Seem Reluctant
"You don't have to share anything you're not comfortable with. But the stories you do share would mean so much to our family."

### When Emotions Come
"Take your time. These feelings are important too."

### At the End
"Thank you for sharing this with me. These stories are a gift our whole family will treasure."

## Include Others

### Family Members
- Siblings might ask different questions
- Grandchildren might unlock playful memories
- Old friends might spark forgotten stories

### Healthcare Staff
If appropriate, nurses and caregivers sometimes hear remarkable stories. Ask if anything stands out.

## After the Recording

### Preserve Immediately
- Back up to cloud storage
- Share with at least one other family member
- Add notes about context while fresh

### Don't Wait to Share
If your loved one wants to hear the recordings or share them with others, do it now. These recordings can bring comfort to everyone.

### Transcribe Key Parts
Even rough transcriptions help preserve stories when voices become hard to hear.

## A Note on Perfection

The recording doesn't need to be perfect. The audio doesn't need to be professional. The stories don't need to be complete.

What matters is that you tried. What matters is that something exists. A single recording of your grandmother's voice is infinitely more valuable than the complete family history you planned to record "someday."

Start today. Start now. Start with whatever you have.
