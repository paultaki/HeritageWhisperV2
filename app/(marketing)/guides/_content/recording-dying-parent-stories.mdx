There's a particular urgency that comes with realizing your parents won't be around forever. Their stories—the ones you've heard a hundred times and the ones you've never thought to ask about—live only in their memories.

This guide is for adult children who want to capture their parents' stories while they still can.

## Why This Feels Hard

Let's acknowledge it: this is emotionally complicated.

Recording your parent's stories means confronting their mortality. It means admitting that someday these recordings will be all you have left. That's a lot to process.

It might also feel awkward. You've known your parents your whole life—suddenly interviewing them can feel strange for both of you.

These feelings are normal. Don't let them stop you.

## Starting the Conversation

### How to Bring It Up

Direct approaches often work best:

- "Mom, I realized I don't know much about your childhood. Would you tell me some stories?"
- "Dad, I want to record some of your memories so [grandchildren's names] can hear them someday."
- "I've been thinking about family history. Can we talk about some of your memories?"

### If They're Reluctant

Some parents resist: "Oh, my life isn't interesting" or "Nobody wants to hear about that."

Gentle persistence helps:
- "It's interesting to me."
- "Your grandchildren will treasure these stories."
- "I just want to hear your voice telling these stories."
- "You're the only one who can tell these stories."

### Making It Comfortable

Frame it as a conversation, not an interview. Share some of your own memories. React to their stories naturally. The best recordings feel like normal conversations, just with a phone recording in the background.

## Questions That Unlock Stories

### About You (Their Child)
Parents love talking about their children:
- "What was I like as a baby?"
- "What worried you most when I was growing up?"
- "What's a memory of me that makes you laugh?"
- "What were your hopes for me when I was born?"

### About Their Parents (Your Grandparents)
This helps fill gaps in family knowledge:
- "What do you wish I knew about Grandma/Grandpa?"
- "What did your parents teach you about life?"
- "What's your favorite memory of your mother?"
- "What did you only understand about your parents after becoming a parent yourself?"

### About Their Life Story
- "What was the happiest time of your life?"
- "What's the hardest thing you've ever been through?"
- "What are you most proud of?"
- "What do you wish you'd done differently?"

### About Your Family
- "What do you love most about our family?"
- "What traditions do you hope we'll keep?"
- "What do you want your grandchildren to know?"

## Practical Recording Tips

### Keep It Simple
Use your smartphone's voice recorder. Fancy equipment just creates barriers.

### Choose Good Moments
- After a meal when everyone's relaxed
- During a drive (if they're not driving)
- While looking at photo albums
- During holidays when memories naturally come up

### Let Tangents Happen
When they drift off-topic, let them. Often the best stories emerge unexpectedly.

### Don't Correct or Argue
Even if you remember something differently, this isn't the time to debate. You're capturing their memory of events.

### Record the Mundane Too
Someday you'll want to hear them say your name. Record casual conversation, not just formal storytelling.

## Dealing with Difficult Topics

### Painful Memories
If they share something painful, let them. Say: "Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like that was really hard."

### Family Conflicts
Old family tensions might surface. You don't have to resolve them. Just acknowledge: "I didn't know you felt that way."

### Things They Regret
If they share regrets, resist the urge to fix it. Sometimes they just need to be heard.

### Things You're Not Ready to Hear
If something is too difficult for you, it's okay to gently redirect: "We can come back to that another time. Tell me about..."

## For Different Situations

### When Health Is Good
Take your time. Make it a regular thing—monthly conversations, holiday recordings, or weekend phone calls.

### When Health Is Declining
See our guide on [Urgent Story Preservation](/guides/urgent-story-preservation). Prioritize the most important stories. Keep sessions short.

### For Estranged Relationships
Even complicated relationships hold valuable stories. You might start with neutral topics (childhood, career) before attempting deeper conversations.

### For Parents with Memory Issues
Focus on older memories, which are often better preserved. Use photos and objects to trigger recollections. Record even fragmented stories—something is always better than nothing.

## After the Recording

### Back Up Everything
Immediately copy recordings to cloud storage and share with siblings.

### Add Notes
While the conversation is fresh, note any names, places, or dates mentioned.

### Share with Family
These stories belong to everyone. Send recordings to siblings, cousins, and your own children.

### Keep Recording
One conversation is a start, not a finish. Build a library of memories over time.

## A Final Thought

You don't need to capture everything. You don't need perfect audio or complete chronological coverage. You just need something.

One recording of your dad's voice. One story from your mom's childhood. One "I love you" captured forever.

Start there. Start now. Start before it's too late.
