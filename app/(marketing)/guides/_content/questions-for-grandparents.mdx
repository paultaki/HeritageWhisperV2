## Tips for Asking These Questions

**Start simple.** The childhood questions are great warmups. Save the deeper questions about regrets and legacy for when you've built momentum.

**Let them wander.** If a question sparks a tangent, follow it. The unexpected stories are often the best ones.

**Record everything.** Memories are precious. Don't trust them to your own memory alone.

**Make it regular.** You won't cover all these questions in one sitting, and that's fine. Make it a recurring conversation.

**Include specific details.** When they mention something, ask follow-ups: "What color was that car?" "How did that make you feel?" Details make stories come alive.
