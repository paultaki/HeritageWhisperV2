# üö® Emergency Prompt Fix - Broken Entity Extraction

## The Bug

Prompts like this were reaching users:
```
"What's something impress the said that you've never forgotten?"
```

This is a **critical bug** in entity extraction, not a quality issue. The system extracted "impress the" as an entity (gibberish) and inserted it into a template.

## Root Cause

The entity extraction regex was grabbing sentence fragments instead of proper nouns:

```typescript
// BAD: Captures fragments like "impress the"
/(\w+\s+the)/gi

// GOOD: Should capture proper nouns
/\b([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)?)\b/g
```

## Immediate Fixes Implemented

### 1. Entity Validation (`/lib/promptQuality.ts`)

Added `isValidEntity()` function that rejects:
- ‚ùå Articles/prepositions alone ("the", "a", "an")
- ‚ùå Ending with articles ("impress the")
- ‚ùå Lone verbs ("said", "told", "was")
- ‚ùå Non-letter starts
- ‚ùå Too short (< 3 chars)
- ‚ùå Sentence fragments ending with conjunctions

### 2. Grammar Validation

Added `hasBrokenEntity()` function that detects:
- ‚ùå "the said", "a told", "an was"
- ‚ùå "something" followed by gibberish
- ‚ùå Multiple consecutive spaces
- ‚ùå "impress the said" patterns
- ‚ùå Article + verb endings

### 3. Quality Scoring

- **Broken entity = instant score of 0**
- Instant rejection (no tolerance)
- Scores weighted:
  - `broken`: -100 (instant zero)
  - `generic`: -40
  - `vague`: -30
  - `therapy`: -20
  - `long`: -15
  - `yes_no`: -10

### 4. Pre-Display Filter (`/app/prompts/page.tsx`)

Added client-side filter as **last line of defense**:
```typescript
const filterBrokenPrompts = (prompts) => {
  return prompts.filter(p => {
    const hasGrammarError = /\s(the|a|an)\s+(said|told|was)/.test(p.prompt_text);
    const hasBrokenEntity = /\b(impress|mention)\s+(the|a)\s+(said|told)/.test(p.prompt_text);
    const tooShort = p.prompt_text.split(' ').length < 5;
    const missingQuestionMark = !p.prompt_text.includes('?');
    
    return !hasGrammarError && !hasBrokenEntity && !tooShort && !missingQuestionMark;
  });
};
```

Even if broken prompts slip through backend, they won't display.

### 5. Emergency Cleanup API (`/app/api/prompts/emergency-cleanup/route.ts`)

Dedicated endpoint to **immediately delete** broken prompts:
- Doesn't save to history (they're garbage)
- Multiple pattern checks
- Logs each deletion
- Returns examples of what was removed

Patterns checked:
- `/\s+(the|a|an)\s+(said|told|was|were|had)\b/i`
- `/impress\s+(the|a)\s+(said|told)/i`
- `/\bthe\s+said\b/i`
- `/\s{2,}/` (multiple spaces)
- Missing question marks
- Too short (< 5 words)

### 6. Admin UI (`/app/admin/cleanup/page.tsx`)

Added prominent "Emergency Cleanup" section:
- Red border, high visibility
- Separate from quality cleanup
- Confirmation dialog
- Shows count of removed prompts
- Auto-refreshes after cleanup

## How to Use

### Option 1: Admin Page (Recommended)
1. Visit: **http://localhost:3001/admin/cleanup**
2. Click **"Run Emergency Cleanup"** (red button at top)
3. Confirm the action
4. See results and refresh

### Option 2: API Directly
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3001/api/prompts/emergency-cleanup' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

## Prevention

### For Future Prompt Generation

1. **Validate entities before use**:
```typescript
import { isValidEntity } from '@/lib/promptQuality';

const entity = extractEntity(story);
if (!isValidEntity(entity)) {
  console.error(`Invalid entity: "${entity}"`);
  return null; // Don't create prompt
}
```

2. **Check result after template substitution**:
```typescript
const result = template.replace('{person}', entity);

// Grammar check
if (/\s(the|a|an)\s+(said|told|was)/.test(result)) {
  console.error(`Grammar error: "${result}"`);
  return null;
}
```

3. **Use proper noun extraction**:
```typescript
// Look for capitalized words (proper nouns)
const properNouns = text.match(/\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)?\b/g);
```

## Validation Layers

**Defense in Depth** - Multiple safety nets:

1. **Generation Time**: Entity validation before creating prompt
2. **Storage Time**: Quality check before saving to database
3. **API Time**: Filter in cleanup endpoints
4. **Display Time**: Client-side filter in UI components

Even if one layer fails, others catch the issue.

## Examples of What Gets Caught

### Broken (Caught)
- ‚ùå "What's something impress the said..."
- ‚ùå "Tell me about the told you..."
- ‚ùå "When a was happening..."
- ‚ùå "something ?" (gibberish after "something")
- ‚ùå "What   about" (multiple spaces)
- ‚ùå Prompts without question marks
- ‚ùå Prompts under 5 words

### Valid (Passes)
- ‚úÖ "What's something John said that stuck with you?"
- ‚úÖ "You mentioned feeling 'housebroken by love' with Chewy..."
- ‚úÖ "When you ran that marathon, what surprised you most?"

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Broken prompts reaching users
- Professional embarrassment
- Loss of trust ("this thing is broken")
- No way to prevent or cleanup

**After Fix:**
- Multiple validation layers
- Emergency cleanup available
- Pre-display filtering
- Clear admin tools
- Zero tolerance for grammar errors

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Entity validation function
- [x] Grammar error detection
- [x] Quality scoring includes 'broken' type
- [x] Pre-display filter in prompts page
- [x] Emergency cleanup API endpoint
- [x] Admin UI with emergency button
- [ ] Test with dev server running
- [ ] Run emergency cleanup on existing data
- [ ] Verify no broken prompts display

## Next Steps

1. **Run emergency cleanup immediately** - Clean existing broken prompts
2. **Add entity validation to generation** - Prevent new broken prompts
3. **Monitor prompt quality** - Track grammar error rate (should be 0%)
4. **Fix root cause** - Update entity extraction logic to use proper nouns
