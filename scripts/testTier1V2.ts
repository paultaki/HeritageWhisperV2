I remember getting Chewy, our first dog, right before our daughter was born.
I felt housebroken by loveâ€”suddenly responsible for this little creature who
trusted me completely. Those first sleepless nights with a newborn, Chewy
would sit by the nursery door, keeping watch. My father taught me responsibility
through his workshop, but Chewy taught me what it meant to show up even when
exhausted. He taught me that love means choosing duty over comfort.

Coach Thompson changed my life. The man knew exactly what to say. I felt scared
that first day at practice, but Coach saw something in me. My father's workshop

believe in myself. The girl who sat next to me didn't understand. But Sarah, my
best friend, she got it. She knew what Coach meant to all of us.

he let me use his tools alone for the first time.

âœ… Story 1: Should generate prompts about Chewy, father, newborn (specific entities)
âœ… Story 2: Should generate 0 prompts (all generic: girl, man, house, room, chair)
âœ… Story 3: Should filter out "the girl" and "the man", keep Coach Thompson, Sarah
âœ… Story 4: Should extract unique phrases and generate relationship prompts

All prompts should:
- Be under 30 words
- Use specific entity names (not "girl", "man", "room")
- Have conversational, relationship-focused tone
- Pass quality validation
