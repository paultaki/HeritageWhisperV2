## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### `family_members`
Tracks invited family members with their status and access history.

**Columns:**
- `id` UUID PRIMARY KEY
- `user_id` UUID (storyteller's user ID)
- `email` TEXT (family member's email)
- `name` TEXT (family member's name)
- `relationship` TEXT (e.g., "Son", "Daughter", "Spouse")
- `status` TEXT ('pending', 'active', 'suspended')
- `invited_at` TIMESTAMPTZ
- `first_accessed_at` TIMESTAMPTZ
- `last_accessed_at` TIMESTAMPTZ
- `access_count` INTEGER
- `created_at` TIMESTAMPTZ

**Indexes:**
- `idx_family_members_user_status` on (user_id, status)
- `idx_family_members_email` on (email)

**RLS:** Users can only manage their own family members

---

### `family_invites`
Magic link tokens for invitations (7-day expiry).

**Columns:**
- `id` UUID PRIMARY KEY
- `family_member_id` UUID (references family_members)
- `token` TEXT UNIQUE (64-char hex)
- `expires_at` TIMESTAMPTZ (7 days from creation)
- `used_at` TIMESTAMPTZ (when first clicked)
- `created_at` TIMESTAMPTZ

**Indexes:**
- `idx_family_invites_token` WHERE used_at IS NULL
- `idx_family_invites_expires` WHERE used_at IS NULL

**RLS:** Service role only (security)

---

### `family_sessions`
Active viewing sessions (30-day expiry, refreshed on activity).

**Columns:**
- `id` UUID PRIMARY KEY
- `family_member_id` UUID
- `token` TEXT UNIQUE (session token, different from invite token)

**Indexes:**
- `idx_family_sessions_token`
- `idx_family_sessions_expires`
- `idx_family_sessions_member` on (family_member_id, expires_at DESC)

**RLS:** Service role only (security)

## üîê Security Model

### Authentication Flow
1. User sends invite ‚Üí Creates `family_member` (pending) + `family_invite` with token
2. Family clicks magic link ‚Üí Verifies token, creates `family_session`
3. Session token stored in localStorage (client-side)
4. Every API call validates session token + user ID match
5. Sessions expire after 30 days of inactivity

### Privacy Controls
- Only stories with `metadata.include_in_timeline = true` OR `metadata.include_in_book = true` are visible
- Family members cannot edit, delete, or record stories
- No access to user profile settings or account info
- Sessions are isolated (different family members can't access each other's sessions)

---

## üé® User Experience

### Invite Flow (Storyteller)
1. Navigate to `/family`
2. Click "Invite Family" button
3. Fill form: email, name (optional), relationship
4. Submit ‚Üí Magic link logged to console (email integration pending)
5. Member appears in "Pending Invitations" list

### Access Flow (Family Member)
1. Receive magic link (currently via console, email in Phase 2)
2. Click link ‚Üí Welcome screen with storyteller name
3. See what they can access (timeline, book, audio, photos)
4. Click "Continue to Timeline" ‚Üí Auto-redirect to timeline
5. Amber banner shows "Viewing [Name]'s Stories" + "View Only" badge
6. Browse stories, listen to audio, view photos
7. Session persists for 30 days

### Visual Design
- **Welcome Screen:** Gradient background, large icons, clear benefits list
- **Timeline/Book:** Amber banner at top, "üëÅ View Only" badges on cards
- **Error Pages:** Helpful messaging with clock/shield icons
- **Responsive:** Mobile-friendly with touch targets

## üêõ Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Column Name Mismatches (FIXED)
**Problem:** Database uses snake_case, code used camelCase  
**Solution:** Updated all queries to use correct column names:
- `firstName` ‚Üí `name`
- `includeInTimeline` ‚Üí `metadata.include_in_timeline`
- `includeInBook` ‚Üí `metadata.include_in_book`
- `storyYear` ‚Üí `year`

### Issue 2: Next.js 15 Params (FIXED)
**Problem:** Dynamic route params must be awaited  
**Solution:** Updated all `[userId]` and `[memberId]` routes to:
```typescript
export async function handler({ params }: { params: Promise<{ userId: string }> }) {
  const { userId } = await params;
  // ...
}
```

### Issue 3: Relationship Constraint (FIXED)
**Problem:** Database had restrictive CHECK constraint on relationship values  
**Solution:** Created migration to remove constraint, allow any text value

## üìä Database Queries

### Check Family Members for User
```sql
SELECT * FROM family_members 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id' 
ORDER BY invited_at DESC;
```

### Check Active Sessions
```sql
SELECT 
  fs.*,
  fm.email,
  fm.name,
  fm.relationship
FROM family_sessions fs
JOIN family_members fm ON fs.family_member_id = fm.id
WHERE fs.expires_at > NOW()
ORDER BY fs.last_active_at DESC;
```

### Clean Up Expired Data
```sql
SELECT cleanup_expired_family_access();
```

## üéì Developer Notes

### Architecture Decisions

**Why localStorage for sessions?**
- No auth required for family members
- Sessions are long-lived (30 days)
- Simplifies UX (no login page)
- Can be upgraded to httpOnly cookies if needed

**Why service role for invites/sessions tables?**
- Security: Don't expose tokens via RLS
- Prevents family members from querying other sessions
- Full control over access patterns

**Why separate session token from invite token?**
- Invite tokens expire after 7 days (one-time use)
- Session tokens expire after 30 days (renewable)
- Allows re-using invite link if session lost

**Why filter stories in JS instead of SQL?**
- Visibility flags stored in JSONB metadata
- Postgres `.or()` doesn't support JSON path queries easily
- Simpler to filter in application code
- Performance impact minimal (users have <100 stories typically)

### Code Patterns

**Client/Server Component Split:**
All family view pages use wrapper pattern:
```typescript
// page.tsx (server component)
export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const { userId } = await params;
  return <ClientComponent userId={userId} />;
}

// client.tsx (client component with hooks)
'use client';
export default function ClientComponent({ userId }) {
  const { session } = useFamilyAuth();
  // React hooks, TanStack Query, etc.
}
```

**Session Validation Pattern:**
Every family API route validates:
1. Session token present in Authorization header
2. Session exists and not expired
3. Family member's user_id matches requested userId

## üéâ Conclusion

Family sharing MVP is **production-ready** with:
- Secure magic link authentication
- Beautiful onboarding experience
- View-only timeline and book access
- 30-day persistent sessions
- Comprehensive error handling

Ready to launch once email integration is added! üöÄ
