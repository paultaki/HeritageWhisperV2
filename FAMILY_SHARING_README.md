# Family Sharing Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed (Phase 1 - Core MVP)

### Database
- ✅ Migration `0004_add_family_sharing.sql` applied
- ✅ 3 tables created: `family_members`, `family_invites`, `family_sessions`
- ✅ RLS policies enabled
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ Cleanup function for expired tokens

### API Routes
- ✅ `POST /api/family/invite` - Send family member invitation
- ✅ `GET /api/family/members` - List user's family members  
- ✅ `DELETE /api/family/[memberId]` - Remove family member
- ✅ `POST /api/family/[memberId]/resend` - Resend invite
- ✅ `GET /api/family/verify` - Verify magic link & create session

### UI
- ✅ `/family` dashboard page with invite form
- ✅ Family member cards (active & pending)
- ✅ Remove member functionality
- ✅ Stats display (members, stories shared, views)
- ✅ Recent activity sidebar

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Invite a Family Member

1. Go to `/family` page
2. Click "Invite Family" button
3. Enter:
   - Email address
   - Relationship (Son, Daughter, etc.)
   - Optional personal message
4. Click "Send Invitation"

### 2. Magic Link Flow

**What happens:**
1. System creates `family_member` record (status: pending)
2. Generates secure 32-byte token
3. Creates `family_invite` with 7-day expiration
4. Logs invite URL to console (in development)
5. TODO: Send email via Resend

**Invite URL format:**
```
http://localhost:3002/family/access?token=abc123...
```

### 3. Family Member Clicks Link

**What happens:**
1. `/family/access?token=xyz` validates token
2. Checks expiration & usage
3. Creates 30-day `family_session`
4. Updates member status to "active"
5. Redirects to family view (TODO: implement family timeline/book view)

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Secure Tokens**: 32-byte cryptographically random
- **Expiration**: 7 days for invites, 30 days for sessions
- **One-time Use**: Invite tokens marked as used
- **RLS Policies**: Users can only see their own family members
- **Cascade Deletion**: Removing member deletes invites & sessions

## 📝 Development Notes

### Console Logging (Development Only)

When you send an invite, check the server console for:
```
=== FAMILY INVITE ===
To: sarah@example.com
From: John Smith
Link: http://localhost:3002/family/access?token=abc123...
Expires: 2025-01-XX
====================
```

Copy this link and paste in browser to test the magic link flow.

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Send invite from `/family` page
- [ ] Check console for magic link
- [ ] Click magic link in new incognito window
- [ ] Verify session created
- [ ] Check member status changed to "active"
- [ ] Verify last_accessed_at timestamp
- [ ] Test remove member functionality
- [ ] Test resend invite (expired & active)

## 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Create Family Access Page**
   - `/family/access/page.tsx` - Verify token & create session
   - Handle errors (expired, invalid, already used)
   - Redirect to family timeline view

2. **Email Integration**
   - Set up Resend API
   - Create HTML email template
   - Send invites via Resend instead of console logging

3. **Family View Pages**
   - `/family/timeline/[userId]` - View-only timeline
   - `/family/book/[userId]` - View-only book
   - Add family auth guard/middleware
   - Add "👁 View only" banner

### Future Enhancements

4. **Resend Invite UI**
   - Add "Resend" button to pending members
   - Call `/api/family/[memberId]/resend`

5. **Activity Tracking**
   - Create `story_views` table
   - Track when family members view stories
   - Show in activity feed

6. **Engagement Features (Phase 2)**
   - Like/heart stories
   - Comment on stories
   - Request stories (prompts from family)

## 📊 Database Schema Reference

### family_members
```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
user_id UUID (storyteller)
email TEXT
name TEXT
relationship TEXT ('spouse', 'child', etc.)
status TEXT ('pending' | 'active' | 'suspended')
invited_at TIMESTAMPTZ
first_accessed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
last_accessed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
access_count INTEGER
```

### family_invites
```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
family_member_id UUID
token TEXT UNIQUE (32-byte hex)
expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ (7 days)
used_at TIMESTAMPTZ
```

### family_sessions
```sql
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
family_member_id UUID
token TEXT UNIQUE (session token)
user_agent TEXT
ip_address TEXT

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Authentication required" error:**
- Make sure you're logged in as a user
- Check that JWT token is being passed in Authorization header

**"Family member not found" error:**
- Verify the member_id belongs to the authenticated user
- Check RLS policies are correctly applied

**"Invalid or expired invite link" error:**
- Token may be expired (7 days)
- Token may have already been used
- Generate new invite via "Resend" button

**No email received:**
- Email sending is not yet implemented
- Check server console for magic link
- Use console link for testing

## 📧 Email Template (TODO)

Will use Resend with this template structure:
- Warm gradient header with logo
- Personal message from storyteller
- Large "View Stories" CTA button
- Expiration notice (7 days)
- Footer with branding

See `/FAMILY_SHARING_README.md` for full email template HTML.
