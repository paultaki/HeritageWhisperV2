    When I turned ten my family moved to California which was a huge change for me because everything was so different there the weather was warm all year round and there were palm trees everywhere and the ocean was just a short drive away I remember the first time I saw the Pacific Ocean I just stood there with my mouth open because I had never seen anything so big and beautiful in my entire life

    High school was an interesting time because that's when everything started changing rock and roll was becoming popular and all the kids were listening to Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry my parents didn't understand it at all they thought it was just noise but we loved it we would go to the local diner after school and play records on the jukebox and dance`;
