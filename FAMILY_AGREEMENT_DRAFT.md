## üìñ SECTION 2: Your Stories Are YOURS

### Simple Truth: You own every word, every photo, every memory.

**What you own:**  
‚úì All your recordings  
‚úì All your photos  
‚úì All your stories  
‚úì Everything you create here  

**What we can do:**  
‚Ä¢ Store it safely  
‚Ä¢ Help you share with family  
‚Ä¢ Create transcriptions  
‚Ä¢ Generate questions to help you remember more  
‚Ä¢ Make backups so nothing gets lost  

**What we'll NEVER do:**  
‚úó Sell your stories  
‚úó Share without permission  
‚úó Use your stories to train AI  
‚úó Claim ownership  

**Want to leave?** Download everything and go. It's all yours.

## ü§ñ SECTION 3: Your Storyteller Features

Think of Storyteller like a helpful librarian who:  
‚Ä¢ Writes down what you say (transcription)  
‚Ä¢ Suggests questions to help you remember more  
‚Ä¢ Never judges or shares your stories  

### Is a human listening?
No. Only computers process your recordings.

### Common Concerns:

**"Will Storyteller get my story wrong?"**  
Sometimes it makes mistakes with:  
‚Ä¢ Unusual names (it might write "John" instead of "Jean")  
‚Ä¢ Heavy accents or whispered words  
‚Ä¢ Background noise  

That's why you can always fix the transcription yourself.

**"Is my story being used to train computers?"**  
Absolutely not. Your stories are processed to help YOU, then forgotten.

**Want to turn off Storyteller features?**  
Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Disable "Enable Storyteller Features"  
(You can still type stories manually)

---

## üöÄ SECTION 4: We're in Beta (Growing Together)

### What "Beta" means in plain English:
We're like a new restaurant that's still perfecting recipes. The food is good, but we're still learning.

**What might happen:**  
‚Ä¢ New features appear (usually good!)  
‚Ä¢ Some features change or disappear  
‚Ä¢ Occasional hiccups or slow moments  
‚Ä¢ You might spot a bug (tell us - we'll fix it!)  

**Your stories are always safe.** Beta doesn't mean risky - it means improving.

**Want to help?** Beta users who send feedback get:  
‚Ä¢ First access to new features  
‚Ä¢ Direct line to our team  
‚Ä¢ Knowing you helped build something special

‚Ä¢ We pay all fees except filing fee

## üîí SECTION 7: Your Privacy, Protected

### Who sees your stories?
