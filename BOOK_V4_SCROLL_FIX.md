# Book V4 Scroll Performance Fix

## Problem
Scrolling through pages in `/book-v4` was very slow and felt sluggish.

## Root Cause
The `BookPage.tsx` component (lines 32-59) contained a custom wheel event handler that:
1. **Intercepted scroll events** with `passive: false` - this blocks browser optimization
2. **Manually manipulated `scrollTop`** - bypasses hardware acceleration and GPU optimization
3. **Used a custom multiplier** (1.5x) - less efficient than native smooth scrolling

```typescript
// OLD CODE (removed):
const handleWheel = (e: WheelEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  const multiplier = e.deltaMode === 0 ? 1.5 : 50;
  scrollElement.scrollTop += e.deltaY * multiplier; // Manual scroll manipulation
};
pageElement.addEventListener('wheel', handleWheel, { passive: false });
```

This approach prevented the browser from using:
- Native smooth scrolling algorithms
- Hardware acceleration
- GPU compositing
- Optimized momentum/inertia scrolling

## Solution
1. **Removed the custom wheel event handler** entirely
2. **Let the browser handle scrolling natively** using existing CSS optimizations in `book.css`:
   - `scroll-behavior: smooth` - enables smooth scrolling
   - `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` - enables momentum scrolling on iOS/trackpad
   - `will-change: scroll-position` - hints to browser for GPU acceleration
   - `overflow-y: scroll` - ensures scrollbar is always visible
   - `overscroll-behavior: contain` - prevents scroll chaining

3. **Added inline styles** to the scrollable div for redundancy:
   ```typescript
   style={{
     scrollBehavior: 'smooth',
     WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch',
     willChange: 'scroll-position'
   }}
   ```

## Benefits
- ✅ **Much faster scrolling** - native browser implementation is highly optimized
- ✅ **Smooth momentum scrolling** - especially on trackpads and touch devices
- ✅ **Hardware acceleration** - GPU rendering for better performance
- ✅ **Better battery life** - less JavaScript execution
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** - matches user's system scroll preferences
- ✅ **Accessibility** - respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting

## Testing
Test the scrolling behavior by:
1. Navigate to `/book-v4`
2. Use mouse wheel to scroll through a page
3. Use trackpad with two-finger scroll
4. Test on mobile/touch devices
5. Verify smooth, fast, and responsive scrolling

## Technical Details
The CSS file (`book.css`) already had excellent scroll optimizations in place. The JavaScript wheel handler was fighting against these optimizations. By removing the handler, we now leverage:

- **Browser's scroll thread** - separate from main JavaScript thread
- **Compositor thread** - hardware-accelerated scroll rendering
- **Native inertia** - platform-specific scroll physics
- **Reduced jank** - no JavaScript execution during scroll

This is a classic example of "less is more" - removing custom code to let the browser do what it does best.
