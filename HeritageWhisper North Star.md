Photo Albums That Talk

Mission
Preserve the stories behind every family photo before the last generation who knows them is gone.

The Problem We Solve
75 million photo albums will become meaningless in the next 20 years. When parents die, their photos become strangers in old clothes. The stories - who these people were, why they mattered, what happened that day - die with them. We're building the bridge between physical photo albums and digital preservation, capturing not just the images but the voices and stories that make them matter.

Our Customer
Primary: Adults 45-65 with aging parents (70-85) who still have physical photo albums Secondary: The parents themselves who want to leave stories for grandchildren 
Urgent Reality: This is the last generation with physical photo albums AND the knowledge of who's in them

Core Product Principle
"Every feature must answer: Does this help someone save a photo's story in under 2 minutes?"
If no, we don't build it.

What We Are Building
The Flow (90 seconds from photo to saved memory)
Capture: Take photo of physical photo (10 sec)
Record: Look at photo while recording story (30-60 sec)
Save: Auto-title, auto-date, one-tap save (20 sec)
Share: Instantly available to family

Core Features
Photo-first capture - Camera is the primary action
Visual recording - See photo while recording
Bulk sessions - Queue multiple photos for story recording
Timeline view - Beautiful chronological display
Family sharing - Simple magic links, no accounts needed
Voice preservation - Keep actual voice, not just transcription

The Trifecta: 
Every memory must have:
Photo (the trigger)
Audio (the story)
Date (the context)
Everything else is optional.

What We Are NOT Building
❌ AI interviewers - Photos are the interviewer ❌ Generic prompts - "Tell me about your childhood" ❌ Text stories - We preserve voice, not essays ❌ Physical books - We're not competing with StoryWorth ❌ Complex editing - If grandma can't do it, we don't build it ❌ Social features - This is private family preservation

Product Decisions Framework
Every decision passes three gates:
Does it reduce friction?
Can grandma do this without help?
Does it work in 2 minutes or less?
Does it preserve what matters?
Photo + Voice + Date
Nothing else is required
Will grandchildren care?
In 2060, will this matter?
Can they access it easily?
The Opportunity
By the numbers:
75 million Baby Boomers with photo albums
Average family has 10-20 albums
200-500 photos per album
5,000 photos × 75M families = 375 billion stories at risk
The urgency:
10,000 Boomers turn 65 daily
Average life expectancy: 78 years
Window closing: 10-15 years
Our Advantages
First mover in photo-triggered audio memories
Simplicity over features (2-minute capture)
Voice preservation (not just text)
Timeline visualization (see your family history)
No competition (others chase book printing)
What Success Looks Like
Year 1: 1,000 families preserve 50,000 photo stories Year 3: 50,000 families preserve 2.5M photo stories Year 5: 500,000 families preserve 25M photo stories
Ultimate Success: A grandchild in 2060 hears their grandmother's voice explaining who's in a photo from 1955.
The Daily Question
"Does this help someone save a photo's story before it's too late?"
If yes, build it fast. If no, ignore it completely.

Remember: We're not building a nice-to-have app. We're in a race against time to preserve family histories before the last generation who knows these stories is gone. Every day matters.
