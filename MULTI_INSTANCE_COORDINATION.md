## üìã Coordination Rules

### ‚úÖ DO:
1. **Check this doc** before starting work
2. **Update status** when you start/finish a task
3. **Claim files** by adding them to your instance section
4. **Use separate branches** for each instance (recommended)
5. **Commit frequently** so others can see your progress
6. **Mark as complete** when done and ready to merge

### ‚ùå DON'T:
1. **Touch files owned by another instance** without coordination
2. **Work on shared files** (like `package.json`, `globals.css`) without checking first
3. **Merge directly to main** if multiple instances are active
4. **Forget to update this doc** when claiming new files

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SHARED FILES (Requires Coordination)

These files are touched by multiple instances - **coordinate before editing**:

- `package.json` - Check with all instances first
- `app/globals.css` - Coordinate on which sections you're editing
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Check first
- `.env.local` - Safe (local only, not committed)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Update after merging, not during work

## üîÑ Workflow

### Starting New Work
1. Open this doc
2. Find your instance section
3. Add files you'll be working on to "Files Owned"
4. Update status to üîÑ IN PROGRESS
5. (Optional) Create a feature branch
6. Start working!

### During Work
- Commit regularly with clear messages
- If you need to touch a file owned by another instance, **STOP** and coordinate first
- Update "Current Task" as you progress

### Finishing Work
1. Mark status as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
2. Commit all changes
3. If using branches, create PR or merge to main

## üÜò Conflict Resolution

### If Two Instances Touch the Same File:

1. **STOP BOTH INSTANCES**
2. Check git log to see what changed
3. Decide which changes to keep
4. Roll back if needed: `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`
5. Update this doc to prevent future collisions
6. Resume one instance at a time on that file

### Prevention Tips:
- **Use `git status`** before starting work
- **Pull latest** before each session
- **Small commits** make rollbacks easier
- **Branch per instance** = easy conflict resolution

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Granular = Better**: Smaller, focused tasks = fewer conflicts
2. **Communicate**: Update this doc frequently
3. **Branch Strategy**: Consider using branches per instance for cleaner merges
4. **Test Before Merge**: Run `npm run dev` after merging to catch issues
5. **Document**: Keep `CLAUDE.md` updated with completed work
