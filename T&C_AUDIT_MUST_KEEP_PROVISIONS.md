## PROVISIONS TO SIMPLIFY/REFRAME

### Legal Jargon to Replace:
- "force majeure" → "events beyond our control (like natural disasters)"
- "indemnification" → "protect us from claims"
- "non-exclusive license" → "permission to use"
- "merchantability" → "works as expected"
- "quiet enjoyment" → "use without interference"

### Sections to Consolidate:
- Combine warranty disclaimers into single "What We Can't Promise" section
- Merge service interruptions with beta disclaimer
- Combine all payment terms in one place

### New Additions Needed:
1. **Elder Protection Hotline** - Not in current
2. **Cognitive Decline Protocol** - Not in current  
3. **Phone Support Number** - Not in current
4. **60-Day Money Back** - Not in current (only no refunds)
5. **Family Billing Alerts** - Not in current

---

## LEGAL RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk Areas:
1. **$500 Liability Cap** - Very low, may not be enforceable
2. **Class Action Waiver** - Increasingly challenged in courts
3. **No Refunds Policy** - Too strict for seniors
4. **Washington Arbitration** - Unfair for nationwide service

### Recommended Changes:
1. Increase liability cap to "12 months of fees paid"
2. Add fairness provisions to arbitration
3. Add 60-day money-back guarantee
4. Allow state choice for arbitration

## SUMMARY

The current T&C contains all necessary legal protections but is:
- Too long (8,000 words)
- Too complex (legal jargon)
- Too intimidating (all caps warnings)
- Missing senior-specific protections
- Buried succession planning

The rewrite must:
1. Keep all critical legal provisions
2. Translate to plain English
3. Reorganize for user priorities
4. Add senior protections
5. Reduce to ~3,000 words main + appendices
