## Language Transformation Examples

### Example 1: AI Disclosure

**OLD:**
> "Voice recordings processed by OpenAI Whisper API... Story text analyzed by GPT-4 to generate personalized follow-up questions..."

**NEW:**
> "Think of our AI like a helpful librarian who:
> â€¢ Writes down what you say (transcription)
> â€¢ Suggests questions to help you remember more
> â€¢ Never judges or shares your stories"

### Example 2: Disclaimers

**OLD:**
> "THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING: MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE..."

**NEW:**
> "We Try Our Best, But Can't Guarantee Perfection
> 
> HeritageWhisper is in beta, which means we're constantly improving. While we work hard to keep everything running smoothly, we can't promise:
> - Perfect transcriptions every time
> - 100% uptime
> - Zero bugs or errors"

### Example 3: Dispute Resolution

**OLD:**
> "YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY, NOT AS A CLASS ACTION. YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS."

**NEW:**
> "Step 1: Just tell us
> â€¢ Email: support@heritagewhisper.com
> â€¢ Call: 1-800-HERITAGE
> â€¢ We solve 95% of issues this way
> 
> Our promise: We'd rather fix problems than fight about them."
