## Implementation Details

### ✅ CHANGE 1: Audio Indicator Enhancement

**Location:** `components/timeline-v2/TimelineCardV2.tsx` (lines 14-158)

**Features Implemented:**
- Replaced orange play button with speaker/waveform icon (Volume2)
- Added "Listen • 2:14" format text label
- Implemented circular progress ring showing playback progress
- Label changes to "Playing..." during playback
- Maintains orange color scheme (#F59E0B) for consistency
- Shows current time / total duration during playback

**Technical Details:**
- SVG circle with `strokeDasharray` and `strokeDashoffset` for smooth progress animation
- AudioManager integration ensures only one audio plays at a time
- Progress updates in real-time with `timeupdate` event listener

---

### ✅ CHANGE 2: Mobile Year Navigation

**Location:** `components/timeline-v2/YearScrubber.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**
- Collapsed state: 60px tall pill showing current year
- Expands to full decade list when tapped
- Fixed position on right edge, vertically centered
- iOS Contacts-style scrollable list
- Smooth scroll to selected decade
- Auto-updates current year based on scroll position
- Only visible on mobile (<768px)

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `IntersectionObserver` to track visible decade
- Smooth scroll with `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`
- Z-index: 40 to float above content
- Custom scrollbar styling for iOS-like appearance

---

### ✅ CHANGE 3: Photo Carousel

**Location:** `components/timeline-v2/TimelineCardV2.tsx` (lines 68-136)

**Features Implemented:**
- First photo shows with "1 of 3 photos" indicator
- 44x44px arrow buttons (ChevronLeft/ChevronRight) for easy tapping
- Horizontal swipe support (75px threshold)
- Dot indicators below image showing position
- Inline carousel (no modal)
- Touch-friendly for seniors

**Technical Details:**
- Touch events: `touchStart`, `touchMove`, `touchEnd`
- Swipe detection with 75px threshold
- Arrow buttons positioned absolutely at 50% Y
- Current photo tracked with `currentPhotoIndex` state
- Works with both new `photos[]` array and legacy `photoUrl`

---

### ✅ CHANGE 4: Year Label Cleanup

**Location:** `components/timeline-v2/TimelineCardV2.tsx` (lines 160-182)

**Desktop Changes:**
- Metadata format: "Age 7 • Summer 1962" (age first)
- No duplicate year markers on timeline spine
- Season detection from `storyDate` (Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter)
- Cleaner, more readable format

**Mobile:**
- No changes - decade headers work well

**Technical Details:**
- `formatMetadata()` function extracts season from date
- Month ranges: Spring (2-4), Summer (5-7), Fall (8-10), Winter (11-1)
- Fallback to year-only if no season data
- Handles edge cases: birth, before birth, no age data

---

### ✅ CHANGE 5: Primary CTA Enhancement

**Mobile Location:** `app/family/timeline-v2/[userId]/client.tsx` (lines 260-271)
**Desktop Location:** `components/timeline-v2/FloatingAddButton.tsx`

**Mobile:**
- Bottom navigation bar with "Add Memory" button
- Icon + text label
- 48px min-height for easy tapping
- Fixed position at bottom

**Desktop:**
- Floating button at right: 40px, bottom: 40px
- Large, obvious styling (60px min-height)
- Icon rotates 90° on hover
- Scale animations on hover/active

**Technical Details:**
- Responsive: mobile nav hidden on desktop, floating button hidden on mobile
- Media query breakpoint: 768px
- Both use same orange color (#F59E0B)
- Plus icon with rotation animation

---

### ✅ CHANGE 6: Empty State

**Location:** `app/family/timeline-v2/[userId]/client.tsx` (lines 139-149, 235-254)

**Features Implemented:**
- Detects years with no memories between min and max year
- Displays count of empty years
- Shows first 5 empty years by name
- Links to prev/next years suggested
- Amber-themed card for consistency

**Technical Details:**
- Calculates range from first to last story year
- Filters out years with stories
- Shows max 5 years, indicates if more exist
- Only appears if stories exist (to show the range)
