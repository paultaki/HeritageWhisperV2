## Final Notes

This transformation from "Terms of Service" to "Family Agreement" represents more than a rewrite - it's a philosophy shift. We're moving from protecting ourselves FROM users to protecting users WITH transparency.

The success of this initiative will be measured not just in comprehension rates, but in increased trust and stronger relationships with our senior users and their families.

**Remember:** Every interaction is an opportunity to demonstrate that we truly care about our users' stories and their families' futures.
