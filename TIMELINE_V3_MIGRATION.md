# Timeline V3 → Production Migration

## Migration Completed: October 20, 2025

### What Happened

Timeline V3's refined design has been promoted to the main `/timeline` route, replacing the previous version.

## Files Modified

### ✅ Backed Up
- `components/timeline/TimelineDesktop.backup.tsx` - Original production version saved

### ✅ Updated  
- `components/timeline/TimelineDesktop.tsx` - Now contains V3 code with export renamed to `TimelineDesktop()`

### ✅ Preserved
- `components/timeline/TimelineDesktopV3.tsx` - V3 version kept intact
- `app/timeline-v3/page.tsx` - Still accessible at `/timeline-v3`

## What's Now Live on `/timeline`

### Visual Improvements
1. **Whisper-style year markers**
   - 16px font (senior-friendly)
   - Minimal padding (compact boxes)
   - 92% opacity with subtle styling
   - Hover reveals full opacity

2. **Removed decade labels**
   - No standalone "1980", "1990" text on timeline
   - Cleaner, less cluttered appearance

3. **Thicker timeline spine**
   - 2.5px width (was 1.5px)
   - Better visibility while maintaining subtlety

4. **Card spacing**
   - `-108px` vertical margin
   - Balanced horizontal/vertical spacing
   - Grid-like appearance

5. **Tight year marker collision**
   - Markers nearly touch before pushing out
   - Smooth fade animation
   - Premium scroll feel

6. **Cleaner card overlays**
   - Removed date from cards (title + age only)
   - Progress bar shows above title when playing
   - Photo count badge moved to top-left

### Layout Improvements
1. **Centered title section**
   - "John Lawson's Journey" aligned with timeline
   - Transform: `translateX(-115px)`

2. **Increased spacing**
   - 50px above title
   - 50px below subtitle

3. **Fixed pointer events**
   - Play buttons now clickable
   - Proper z-index layering
   - Click zones properly isolated

## Testing

### Routes Available
- **`/timeline`** - NEW V3 design (production)
- **`/timeline-v3`** - Still works (duplicate of production)
- **Old backup** - Available in `TimelineDesktop.backup.tsx` if needed

### What to Test
- [ ] Year marker collision on scroll
- [ ] Play button functionality
- [ ] Card click to open story
- [ ] Progress bar seeking
- [ ] Title/subtitle positioning
- [ ] Card spacing (horizontal ~110px, vertical ~110px)
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Mobile view (uses TimelineMobile - unchanged)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, restore the original:

```bash
cp components/timeline/TimelineDesktop.backup.tsx components/timeline/TimelineDesktop.tsx
```

## Key Differences from Original

| Feature | Original | V3 (Now Production) |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Decade labels | Gray pills | Removed |
| Year markers | Bold, opaque | Whisper-style (92% opacity) |
| Year marker size | Large padding | Compact (py-0.5 px-2.5) |
| Card date overlay | Calendar icon + date | Age only |
| Timeline spine | 1px | 2.5px |
| Collision spacing | Loose (~100px gap) | Tight (nearly touching) |
| Card spacing | `-50px` | `-108px` |
| Title position | Left-aligned | Centered to timeline |

## Performance Notes

- No additional dependencies added
- Same component structure and hooks
- Animations use GPU-accelerated properties (opacity, transform)
- Smooth 60fps scroll performance maintained

## Next Steps

1. Monitor user feedback on new design
2. Consider applying similar refinements to TimelineMobile
3. May deprecate `/timeline-v3` route once production is stable
4. Update documentation/screenshots to reflect new design
