# Book Scaling Enhancement - Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The book view now dynamically scales from **0.95x to 1.3x** based on viewport width, making better use of available space on larger screens while preserving the mobile experience.

## üéØ What Changed

### Before
- Desktop: Book locked at 1.0x scale (lots of wasted space)
- iPad Pro/Air: Book locked at 1.0x scale (wasted space)
- Mobile: Book at 1.0x scale ‚úì

### After
- **Desktop (1920px)**: Book scales to ~1.25-1.3x (25-30% larger)
- **iPad Pro (1366px)**: Book scales to ~1.05-1.1x (5-10% larger)
- **iPad Air (1180px)**: Book scales to ~1.0-1.05x (subtle improvement)
- **Mobile (‚â§640px)**: Book locked at 1.0x scale ‚úì (UNCHANGED)

## üìã Testing Checklist

### 1. Desktop Testing (Required)

Navigate to: **http://localhost:3002/book**

#### Large Desktop (1920√ó1080 or wider)
- [ ] Book should appear **significantly larger** than before
- [ ] Text should be readable (not too large)
- [ ] Pages should be centered
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Spread view (two pages side-by-side)

**How to test:**
```
1. Open browser to full screen on large monitor
2. Navigate to /book
3. Book should fill more of the screen
4. Verify text size is comfortable (20-26px range)
```

#### Medium Desktop (1440√ó900)
- [ ] Book should appear **moderately larger** than before
- [ ] Pages centered with reasonable margins
- [ ] Spread view maintained

#### Small Desktop (1280√ó720)
- [ ] Book at baseline 1.0x scale
- [ ] Still comfortable to read

### 2. iPad Testing (Recommended)

#### iPad Pro 12.9" (1366√ó1024 landscape)
- [ ] Book should be **5-10% larger** than before
- [ ] No wasted space at edges
- [ ] Spread view (two pages)
- [ ] Text readable and not cramped

#### iPad Air (1180√ó820 landscape)
- [ ] Book slightly larger or same as before
- [ ] Spread view or single page (depending on chrome)
- [ ] Proper centering

#### iPad Portrait Mode
- [ ] Single page view
- [ ] Appropriate scaling
- [ ] No content cutoff

### 3. Mobile Testing (CRITICAL - Must Not Change)

#### iPhone Pro Max (430px width)
- [ ] **MUST look identical to before**
- [ ] Single page view
- [ ] 1.0x scale (no scaling)
- [ ] Text size unchanged
- [ ] Brown borders visible
- [ ] Content padding correct

#### iPhone Standard (390px width)
- [ ] **MUST look identical to before**
- [ ] Same as above

#### Small Phones (360px width)
- [ ] **MUST look identical to before**
- [ ] Same as above

**How to test mobile:**
```
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Click device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Select "iPhone 14 Pro Max"
4. Navigate to /book
5. Compare to production - should be IDENTICAL
6. Test iPhone 12 (390px)
7. Test smallest preset (360px)
```

### 4. Content Integrity Testing (All Sizes)

For each viewport size above, verify:

- [ ] **No text cutoff** - all paragraphs fully visible
- [ ] **Page numbers visible** in corners
- [ ] **Photos render correctly** and are not clipped
- [ ] **Audio player visible** and not cut off
- [ ] **Edit buttons** in headers are accessible
- [ ] **Running headers** show story title/year/age
- [ ] **Pagination intact** - stories flow across pages correctly
- [ ] **Spine shadow** visible between spread pages
- [ ] **Decade intro pages** render properly
- [ ] **Whisper pages** display correctly
- [ ] **Table of contents** navigates to correct pages

### 5. Responsive Behavior Testing

Test viewport resizing:

- [ ] **Smooth transitions** when resizing browser
- [ ] **No layout shifts** or jumps
- [ ] **Scale updates dynamically** as you resize
- [ ] **Centering maintained** at all sizes
- [ ] **Mobile breakpoint (640px)** locks scale correctly

**How to test:**
```
1. Start with browser at 1920px wide
2. Slowly resize narrower
3. Watch book scale down smoothly
4. At 640px, should lock at 1.0x
5. Resize wider - should scale back up
```

### 6. Navigation Testing

- [ ] **Arrow keys** work (left/right)
- [ ] **Click navigation** works (click page edges)
- [ ] **Swipe gestures** work on mobile
- [ ] **Progress bar** navigation works
- [ ] **Decades pill** (mobile) navigation works
- [ ] **TOC links** jump to correct pages

### 7. Performance Testing

- [ ] **No lag** when changing pages
- [ ] **No jank** during scale transitions
- [ ] **Fonts load properly** before pagination
- [ ] **Images load smoothly**

## üêõ What to Look For (Common Issues)

### Desktop Issues
- ‚ùå Text too large/small
- ‚ùå Pages not centered
- ‚ùå Horizontal scrolling appears
- ‚ùå Content cut off at edges

### iPad Issues
- ‚ùå Book doesn't scale up enough
- ‚ùå Spread view broken
- ‚ùå Text too small despite larger viewport

### Mobile Issues (Critical!)

## üîß How to Test Specific Breakpoints

Using Chrome DevTools:

// Open Console (F12), paste this to test specific viewport:

// iPad Pro Landscape
window.resizeTo(1366, 1024);

// Large Desktop
window.resizeTo(1920, 1080);

// Mobile (iPhone 14 Pro Max)
window.resizeTo(430, 932);
```

Or manually:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Click "Toggle device toolbar" (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Click "Dimensions" dropdown
4. Select "Responsive"
5. Enter custom width (e.g., 1920px, 1366px, 640px, 430px)

## üìä Expected Scale Values by Viewport

| Viewport Width | Expected Scale | Body Font Size | View Mode |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1920px+        | 1.25-1.3x      | 25-26px        | Spread    |
| 1700-1919px    | 1.2-1.25x      | 24-25px        | Spread    |
| 1500-1699px    | 1.15-1.2x      | 23-24px        | Spread    |
| 1366px (iPad Pro) | 1.05-1.1x   | 21-22px        | Spread    |
| 1280-1365px    | 1.0-1.05x      | 20-21px        | Spread    |
| 900-1279px     | 1.0x           | 20px           | Spread/Single |
| 641-899px      | 1.0x           | 20px           | Single    |
| **‚â§640px**     | **1.0x (LOCKED)** | **20px**    | **Single** |

- What specific content is broken
- Expected vs actual behavior

## üéâ Next Steps

Once testing is complete and approved:
