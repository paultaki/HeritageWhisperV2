- Enabled paragraph splits: `break-inside: auto`
- Audio player styled for absolute positioning
- Updated pagination: 70px more text capacity on first pages (295px vs 225px)

**In Progress**:
- Structural rebuild for resize stability
- Container query architecture
- Responsive scaling system

## Current File Structure

### Production Files
- `/app/book/` - Production with zoom controls
- `/app/timeline/` - Production with V3 design
- `/components/timeline/TimelineDesktop.tsx` - V3 features active
- `/components/MobileNavigation.tsx` - Compact labels

### Development Files  
- `/app/book-v2/` - Your working version (preserved)
- `/app/book-v3/` - Major rebuild in progress
- `/components/timeline/TimelineDesktop.backup.tsx` - Original timeline backup
- `/components/timeline/TimelineDesktopV3.tsx` - V3 component (duplicate)

## Book V3 Rebuild Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: Text Pagination & Bottom Spacing
- Equal padding on all sides
- Audio removed from page flow
- Paragraph splits enabled
- 70px more text on first pages

### üöß Phase 2 In Progress: Structural Stability
Next steps:
1. Implement fixed-size container (528px or 1086px)
2. Single zoom transform at top level
3. Remove competing scale calculations
4. Center with flexbox
5. Test resize stability

### ‚è≥ Remaining Phases:
- Phase 3: Enhanced text flow optimization
- Phase 4: Audio player final positioning
- Phase 5: Full responsive architecture
- Phase 6: Print-ready verification

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Timeline collision**: Use card negative margin to control year marker spacing
2. **Zoom approach**: Simple transform scale (not complex viewport calculations)
3. **Audio positioning**: Absolute, outside content flow
4. **Text pagination**: Browser-native widow/orphan control (not JS)
5. **Mobile header**: Fixed top bar with horizontal controls

## Issues Resolved

1. ‚úÖ Timeline year markers "Before birth" showing incorrectly
2. ‚úÖ Timeline age labels (now "Birthday" for age 0)
3. ‚úÖ Timeline rounded corners turning square on hover
4. ‚úÖ Navigation tooltips clarity
5. ‚úÖ Interview chat question clutter
6. ‚úÖ Book zoom overlapping hamburger menu
7. ‚úÖ Decade navigation button not working (removed pill dependency)
8. ‚úÖ React Hooks order violation in TimelineMobile
9. ‚úÖ Timeline year marker collision spacing
10. ‚úÖ Book-v2 recovery from git

## Next Session Priority

Continue Book V3 rebuild:
1. Complete Phase 2: Structural stability with fixed container
2. Test across all device sizes
3. Verify text flow improvements
4. Test audio player positioning
5. Ensure print output remains 5.5√ó8.5

## Notes for Next Time

- Book-v2 and book-v3 are both preserved
- Original book untouched and working
- Timeline V3 is now production
- All major UI improvements are live
- Foundation laid for book v3 rebuild

Total changes implemented: ~50+ files touched across timeline, navigation, book, and interview features.
